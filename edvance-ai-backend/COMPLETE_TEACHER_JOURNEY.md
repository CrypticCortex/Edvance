The system leverages Firebase authentication, personalized learning paths, and ultra-fast AI-powered lesson creation.

---

## üö™ Phase 1: Teacher Authentication & Setup

### 1.1 Teacher Account Creation (Updated)

**Endpoint**: `POST /v1/auth/signup`

```json
{
  "email": "teacher@school.edu",
  "password": "secure_password",
  "role": "teacher", // "teacher" or "student"
  "first_name": "Jane",
  "last_name": "Doe"
}
```

**System Actions**:
- Creates Firebase Authentication account
- Generates unique teacher UID
- Initializes teacher document in Firestore
- Stores role, first_name, last_name, and sets up empty subjects array

**Response**:
```json
{
  "uid": "teacher_uid_abc123",
  "email": "teacher@school.edu",
  "created_at": "2025-07-21T10:00:00Z",
  "subjects": [],
  "role": "teacher",
  "first_name": "Jane",
  "last_name": "Doe"
}
```

### 1.2 Teacher Login & Profile Setup (Updated)

**Endpoint**: `GET /v1/auth/me`

Teachers authenticate using Firebase tokens and can view their profile, which now includes:
- `uid`, `email`, `created_at`, `subjects`, `role`, `first_name`, `last_name`

**Example Response**:
```json
{
  "uid": "teacher_uid_abc123",
  "email": "teacher@school.edu",
  "created_at": "2025-07-21T10:00:00Z",
  "subjects": ["Mathematics", "Science"],
  "role": "teacher",
  "first_name": "Jane",
  "last_name": "Doe"
}
```

**Profile Update**: `PUT /v1/auth/me/profile`

```json
{
  "subjects": ["Mathematics", "Science", "English"],
  "first_name": "Jane",
  "last_name": "Doe",
  "role": "teacher"
}
```

- The profile update endpoint supports updating name, role, and subjects.

### 1.3 Logout (New)

**Frontend Logic**:
- Signs out from Firebase
- Removes idToken from localStorage
- Redirects to `/auth/login`

**Backend Endpoint**: `POST /v1/auth/logout`
- Revokes refresh tokens for the user

### 1.4 Error Handling & Session Management (New)
- Improved error messages for login failures (invalid credentials, user not found, etc.)
- Graceful handling of expired/invalid sessions: users are redirected to login with a clear message
- Unauthenticated access to `/dashboard` is redirected to `/auth/login`

### 1.5 Role-Based Dashboard (New)
- The dashboard UI and features are rendered based on the user's `role` (teacher or student)
- User's name (first and last) is displayed throughout the dashboard if available

---

## üìä Phase 2: Student Assessment & Performance Analysis

### 2.1 Student Assessment Creation

Teachers create assessments to evaluate student understanding before lesson generation.

**Endpoint**: `POST /v1/assessments/enhanced/create`

```json
{
  "title": "Grade 5 Math Assessment",
  "subject": "Mathematics",
  "grade": 5,
  "topics": ["Addition", "Subtraction", "Basic Multiplication"],
  "questions": [
    {
      "question_text": "What is 25 + 37?",
      "options": ["60", "62", "65", "58"],
      "correct_answer": 1,
      "topic": "Addition",
      "difficulty": "medium"
    }
  ],
  "estimated_duration_minutes": 30
}
```

### 2.2 Student Completes Assessment

Students take the assessment through the platform, and results are automatically captured.

**Student Submission Data**:
```json
{
  "student_id": "student_123",
  "assessment_id": "assess_456",
  "student_answers": [1, 0, 2, 1, 0],
  "time_taken_minutes": 25,
  "submission_timestamp": "2025-07-21T11:30:00Z"
}
```

### 2.3 Automated Assessment Analysis

**Endpoint**: `POST /v1/personalized-learning/analyze-assessment`

The system automatically:
- Calculates performance scores by topic
- Identifies knowledge gaps and misconceptions
- Determines difficulty level comfort
- Analyzes learning patterns and time management

**Analysis Result**:
```json
{
  "student_id": "student_123",
  "overall_score": 68.5,
  "topic_scores": {
    "Addition": 85.0,
    "Subtraction": 60.0,
    "Basic Multiplication": 45.0
  },
  "identified_gaps": [
    {
      "gap_id": "gap_multiplication_basics",
      "topic": "Basic Multiplication",
      "severity_score": 0.85,
      "description": "Struggles with single-digit multiplication facts"
    }
  ],

```

### 3.2 Agent Workflow - Automated Response

Once monitoring is active, the system automatically:

1. **Detects Assessment Completion**
2. **Triggers Performance Analysis**
3. **Identifies Intervention Type**:
   - `comprehensive` (score < 70%): Full learning path
   - `targeted_improvement` (70-85%): Focused gap addressing
   - `enrichment` (>85%): Advanced challenges

**Automatic Learning Path Generation**:
```json
