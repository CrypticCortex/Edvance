# 🎯 Streamlined API Documentation Guide

## Overview

The Edvance AI platform now provides **streamlined API documentation** showing only the **22 core endpoints** essential for the teacher workflow, instead of the overwhelming 73+ total endpoints.

## 🚀 Quick Access

- `/v1/agent/*` (agent invocation, health)

#### Advanced Assessment Features  
- `/v1/assessments/*` (basic assessment creation)
- `/v1/assessments/rag/*` (RAG-based assessments)

#### Document Management
- `/v1/documents/*` (upload, management, processing)

#### Advanced Features

- Development UI endpoints
- Internal debugging tools

## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### Configuration Files

1. **`app/core/streamlined_docs.py`**
   - Main filtering logic
   - Custom OpenAPI schema generation
   - Path pattern matching for parameters

2. **`app/core/api_config.py`**
   - Endpoint categorization
   - Environment-based filtering
   - Documentation templates

3. **`app/core/app_factory.py`**
   - Integration with FastAPI app
   - Streamlined documentation activation

### How It Works

```python
# Core endpoints are defined
core_endpoints = {
    "/v1/auth/signup",
    "/v1/learning/start-monitoring",
    "/v1/lessons/lessons/create-from-step",
    # ... etc
}

# OpenAPI schema is filtered
def create_streamlined_openapi_schema(app):
    full_schema = get_openapi(...)
    filtered_paths = {}
    
    for path, path_info in full_schema["paths"].items():
        if path_matches_core_endpoints(path):
            filtered_paths[path] = path_info
    
    return filtered_schema
```

## 📈 Benefits

### For Teachers
- **No Confusion**: Only see relevant endpoints
- **Clear Workflow**: Organized by teaching phases
- **Quick Reference**: Easy to find what you need
- **Less Overwhelming**: 22 vs 73+ endpoints

### For Developers
- **Clean Integration**: Focus on core features
- **Better Testing**: Streamlined endpoint validation
- **Clear Documentation**: Purpose-driven API reference
- **Maintenance**: Easier to update core workflow

## 🧪 Testing & Validation

### Test Script Usage
```bash
# Test the streamlined documentation
python test_streamlined_api.py
```

**Expected Output:**
```
🔍 TESTING STREAMLINED API DOCUMENTATION
✅ Server is running
📊 Core Endpoints: 22
📋 Total endpoints shown: 22-25
✅ All core workflow endpoints present
✅ All unwanted endpoints successfully filtered
🎉 SUCCESS: Streamlined API documentation is working correctly!
```

### Manual Verification
1. Visit http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs
2. Count total endpoints (should be ~22)
3. Verify all core workflow phases are represented
4. Confirm no debug/agent/rag endpoints visible

## 🔄 Environment Configuration

### Development Mode
```bash
export ENVIRONMENT=development
# Shows core + advanced endpoints (~30 total)
```

### Production Mode
```bash
export ENVIRONMENT=production  
# Shows only core endpoints (~22 total)
```

## 📚 API Documentation Structure

The streamlined docs organize endpoints into clear categories:

```
🎓 Edvance AI - Core Teacher Workflow API

👤 Authentication
  └── Teacher account and profile management

👥 Students
  └── Student data management and upload

🤖 Personalized Learning  
  └── AI-powered learning path generation (~27s)

📚 Lessons
  └── Ultra-fast lesson creation and chatbot support

⚕️ Health
  └── System health and status checks
```

## 🎯 Success Metrics

- **Endpoint Count**: 22 core endpoints (70% reduction)
- **Load Time**: Faster documentation loading
- **User Experience**: Clear, purpose-driven interface
- **Workflow Completion**: All teacher journey phases covered
- **No Missing Features**: Core functionality fully accessible

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### Issue: Too Many Endpoints Still Showing
- Check `ENVIRONMENT` variable
- Verify filtering logic in `streamlined_docs.py`
- Run test script to identify unwanted endpoints

### Issue: Missing Core Endpoints
- Check endpoint patterns in `api_config.py`
- Verify path parameter matching logic
- Update core endpoint list if new features added

### Issue: Documentation Not Updating
- Restart the server
- Clear browser cache
- Check console for errors
