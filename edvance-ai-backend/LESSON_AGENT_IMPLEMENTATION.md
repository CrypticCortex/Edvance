## 🤖 Chatbot Integration

### Features
- **Context-Aware**: Knows current lesson and slide content
- **Grade-Appropriate**: Adjusts language for target grade level
- **Encouraging**: Provides positive, supportive responses
- **Educational**: Guides learning without giving direct answers

### Example Interaction
```
Student: "I don't understand what a fraction means"

Agent: "Great question! Think of a fraction like sharing a pizza. 
If you have 1 pizza and cut it into 4 equal pieces, each piece 
is 1/4 of the whole pizza. The bottom number (4) tells us how 
many pieces the pizza was cut into, and the top number (1) 
tells us how many pieces we're talking about. 

Would you like me to show you another example with something 
different than pizza?"
```
