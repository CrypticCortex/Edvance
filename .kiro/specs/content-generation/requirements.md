# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Content Generation feature for Edvance AI Teaching Assistant enables teachers to upload educational materials (PDFs, images) which are then processed, vector indexed, and stored for later use in generating personalized learning materials. The system will allow teachers to specify grade levels, subjects, and student profiles to generate tailored educational content based on previously uploaded materials and student assessment data.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Document Upload and Processing

**User Story:** As a teacher, I want to upload educational materials (PDFs, images) so that the system can use them to generate personalized learning content.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a teacher uploads PDF documents or images THEN the system SHALL accept and validate the files.
2. WHEN files are uploaded THEN the system SHALL display a progress indicator showing the indexing status.
3. WHEN processing files THEN the system SHALL extract text content from PDFs and images using OCR if necessary.
4. WHEN extracting content THEN the system SHALL maintain the structural integrity of the educational material (headings, sections, etc.).
5. WHEN files are processed THEN the system SHALL generate vector embeddings for efficient semantic search.
6. WHEN files are processed THEN the system SHALL store both the raw content and vector embeddings in appropriate databases.
7. WHEN indexing is complete THEN the system SHALL notify the user that their materials are ready for content generation.
8. IF the uploaded file is invalid or corrupted THEN the system SHALL provide a clear error message to the user.

### Requirement 2: Content Storage and Indexing

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want uploaded content to be properly indexed and stored so that it can be efficiently retrieved for content generation.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN content is processed THEN the system SHALL store raw documents in a document database.
2. WHEN content is processed THEN the system SHALL store vector embeddings in a vector database optimized for similarity search.
3. WHEN storing content THEN the system SHALL associate it with the teacher who uploaded it.
4. WHEN storing content THEN the system SHALL tag it with relevant metadata (subject, grade level, date uploaded).
5. WHEN indexing content THEN the system SHALL ensure the vector database is optimized for fast retrieval.
6. WHEN the system completes indexing THEN it SHALL update the content status to "indexed" in the database.
7. IF the indexing process fails THEN the system SHALL log detailed error information and notify administrators.

### Requirement 3: Content Generation Request

**User Story:** As a teacher, I want to request personalized learning materials by specifying grade level, subject, and student profile so that I can provide tailored educational content.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a teacher initiates content generation THEN the system SHALL provide options to select grade level (classes 1-5).
2. WHEN a teacher initiates content generation THEN the system SHALL provide options to select a subject from their handling subjects.
3. WHEN a teacher initiates content generation THEN the system SHALL provide options to select a specific student profile.
4. WHEN a teacher submits a content generation request THEN the system SHALL validate that all required parameters are provided.
5. WHEN generating content THEN the system SHALL use the teacher's uploaded materials as context.
6. WHEN generating content THEN the system SHALL consider the selected student's previous assessment results.
7. IF no indexed content is available for the selected subject THEN the system SHALL notify the teacher that more materials need to be uploaded.

### Requirement 4: Personalized Content Generation

**User Story:** As a teacher, I want the system to generate personalized learning materials based on my uploaded content and student profiles so that I can provide tailored education.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN generating content THEN the system SHALL retrieve relevant information from the vector database based on subject and grade level.
2. WHEN generating content THEN the system SHALL consider the student's learning level based on previous assessments.
3. WHEN generating content THEN the system SHALL create materials that are appropriate for the specified grade level.
4. WHEN generating content THEN the system SHALL adapt the difficulty based on the student's performance history.
5. WHEN content is generated THEN the system SHALL provide options to preview, edit, and save the generated materials.
6. WHEN content is generated THEN the system SHALL allow teachers to regenerate with modified parameters if needed.
7. IF the content generation process takes longer than expected THEN the system SHALL provide status updates to the user.

### Requirement 5: API Integration

**User Story:** As a developer, I want well-defined API endpoints for content upload, indexing, and generation so that the frontend can interact seamlessly with the backend services.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN designing the API THEN the system SHALL provide endpoints for document upload with appropriate authentication.
2. WHEN designing the API THEN the system SHALL provide endpoints to check indexing status.
3. WHEN designing the API THEN the system SHALL provide endpoints for content generation requests.
4. WHEN implementing the API THEN the system SHALL ensure all endpoints are properly documented.
5. WHEN implementing the API THEN the system SHALL include appropriate error handling and status codes.
6. WHEN implementing the API THEN the system SHALL ensure all endpoints are secured with proper authentication.
7. IF an API request fails THEN the system SHALL return meaningful error messages to help troubleshoot issues.
